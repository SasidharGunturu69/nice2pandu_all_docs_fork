Docker : containerization tool.

What is Docker and why it is used?
Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.


Is Docker a virtual machine?
A VM lets you run a virtual machine on any hardware. Docker lets you run an application on any operating system. It uses isolated user-space instances known as containers. Docker containers have their own file system, dependency structure, processes, and network capabilities.

What is container and how it works?
Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment. In this way, containers virtualize the operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public cloud or even on a developer's personal laptop.



virtulization :

vmware : multiple operating systems manage --->> windows , ubuntu , linux..

Hypervisor --->>> vmware.--->> vitulization.

heavy weight --->> hard ware (cpu , memory , hard disk utilization)

not easy to move.

effective utilization hardware resourcess.


===========================================================


continerzation :

docker install -->>> dokerdaemon --->>> containers

container is nothing but operating system.-

container is nothing but server.

leight weight --->>>no need to take hardware utilization 

easy to move.

less utilization of hardware resources..


=========================================================

Docker : developers develope the code and that code can be shipped them into container..

application -->>> end user.

one ec2 instance ---->> docker install -->>> containers --->>> n no.of conatinaers it dependent on the system hardware..

n no .of apps -->> deploy..

=======================================================================

Docker key components :

docker image --->> pull

docker conainer : image -->>> container

dockerhub  / docker registry : images -->> backup 

Docker file -->> image create.

Docker architecture:

Docker is a client / server architecture.


Docker work flow    : Dev / QA / UAt / PROD
===================================================




docker installation steps:

1. we need to take one ec2 instance..

2. install docker 

yum install -y docker

service docker start


ifconfig -a

docker 0 --->>> bridge network.

c1 , c2 , c3 .....IP allocate. ( internal) --->> throgh loop back address.

=============================================================================
Docker Image Basic commands :

1.docker pull nginx  =====>> Pull docker image to local host

2. docker images  ===>> Show all images on the host

3.docker rmi 39c2d1c93266  ===>> Remove a specific image

4. sudo docker run -itd -p 30:80 ubuntu

5. docker rmi -f $(docker images)  ==>> Remove all images forcibly.

=============================================================================

Docker Container Basic commands :

1.docker run -itd(intaractivedeamon) -p 2000:80 nginx ===>> creating docker container 
2.docker ps (show running containers)
	
3.docker ps -a (show running and exited containers)

4.docker stop 725a4a748b3b

5. docker start 725a4a748b3b

6. docker restart 725a4a748b3b

7. docker ps -aq (return all container ids)

8. docker rm 725a4a748b3b

9.docker logs 725a4a748b3b  ==>>> Check container logs

10. Getting into the container  ==>> docker exec -it 725a4a748b3b /bin/bash

11. docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)  ==>>> Remove all containers forcibly.


docker container creation------
	docker run -itd --name pandu -p cp:hostport imageid
	docker run -itd --name pandu -p 9090:80 imageid

docker images
	docker image ls
	docker inspect imageid (to complete information of docimg)

container login-----
	docker exec -it containerid /bin/bash
	exit (to logout)


backup dockerimage-------
docker login (to login into dockerhub)
docker tag repositoryname:tagname userid/repositoryname:tagname
docker tag nginx:latest nice2pandu/devenv:nginxbup

docker push nice2pandu/devenv:nginxbup



============================================================================

Docker file: it is atext file .

it contains instructions --->>> docker/ conatiner instructions.

keywords

from copy environment port..

Dockerfile -->> name should be unique.

Creating Docker Image

1. To create docker image we need to write Dockerfile

2. To write Dockerfile we should know the instructions.

Dockerfile Instructions 

1. As per convention filename is Dockerfile  and This file is usually present is project root directory


FROM ==>> FROM is used to specify the base image.

LABEL ==>>This is to add labels, labels are like meta info for the images

RUN : Run commands on docker image

WORKDIR : It makes the directory as PWD if the folder is not present it creates.

EXPOSE : This is to open a port on the container

CMD :This is useful to run commands at Docker run time. and This command can be used for starting applications at container start time.

ENTRYPOINT :This is similar to CMD, it is also runtime instruction but it has little different behaviour.

COPY : To copy file from local host to docker image and Source can be only local filesystem

ADD :ADD a file to docker image and Source can be local filesystem or remote url


==============================================================

jenkins integrate with docker.

step 1:  we need to install this plugin : PublishoverSSH.

step 2: we need to configure SSH between jenkins and docker instancess.

step 3:  jenkins dash board ==>> manage jenkins ==>> configure system ===>> add ssh servers ==>>> docker3 user credentials 

step 4 : jenkins ==>> create job.


docker3     ALL=(ALL)           NOPASSWD: ALL
